Cassidoo's Jan 27, 2025 interview question of the week from her
[newsletter](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/if-you-are-interested-in-what-you-do-that-keeps/).

---

Given two strings, `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of
`p`'s anagrams in `s`.

Examples:

```python
findAnagrams("cbaebabacd", "abc")
> [0, 6]

findAnagrams("fish", "cake")
> []

findAnagrams("abab", "ab")
> [0, 1, 2]
```
