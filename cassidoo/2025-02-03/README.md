Cassidoo's 2025-02-03 interview question of the week.

---

**Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as Reverse
Polish Notation) and returns the result.** The expression will contain
single-digit integers and the operators +, -, \*, and /. You can assume the input
is always a valid expression!

```python
Examples:

evaluatePostfix('12+')
> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*')
> 77
```
