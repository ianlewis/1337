Cassidoo's Feb 3, 2025 interview question of the week from her
[newsletter](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/if-im-scared-be-scared-allow-it-release-it-move/).

---

**Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as Reverse
Polish Notation) and returns the result.** The expression will contain
single-digit integers and the operators +, -, \*, and /. You can assume the input
is always a valid expression!

```python
Examples:

evaluatePostfix('12+')
> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*')
> 77
```
