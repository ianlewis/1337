Cassidoo's Feb 10, 2025 interview question of the week from her
[newsletter](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/the-world-is-a-museum-of-other-peoples-passion/).

---

**Given the current [system of NFL uniform
numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_uniform_numbers?utm_source=cassidoo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-world-is-a-museum-of-other-peoples-passion#Current_system),
a given player's position, and an array of existing numbers on the team, write a
function that returns a list of numbers that the given player can choose from
for their uniform.**

Example:

```python
> availableNumbers("QB", [1, 2, 3, 10, 19])
> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```
