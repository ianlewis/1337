Cassidoo's Feb 24, 2025 interview question of the week from her
[newsletter](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/we-must-choose-kind-words-that-lift-people-up/).

---

Given a list of frequencies (in Hz), write a function to determine the closest
musical note for each frequency [based on the A440 pitch
standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation?utm_source=cassidoo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=we-must-choose-kind-words-that-lift-people-up#Table_of_note_frequencies).
Extra credit: indicate if the note is flat or sharp!

Example:

```python
getNoteNames([440, 490, 524, 293.66])
> ["This is a A", "This is a B, but it's flat", "This is a C, but it's sharp", "This is a D"]
```
